## Grammar Explanation

1. Use the present perfect to talk about things that happened at an **indefinite time in the past**. You can use the present perfect when you don't know when something happened or when the specific time is not important.

   #### Examples

   - They've won several awards.
   - I've interviewed the whole cast.
   - She's been in a Hollywood movie.
   - I've seen his show many times.
   - I've just finish the book. (I finished it a little while ago.)

2. You can use **ever** with the **present perfect** to **ask questions**. It means at nay time up until now. Use **Never** to **answer negatively**.

   #### Examples

   - Have you won an award?
   - Have you ever won an award?
   - No, I've never won.
   - No, never.

3. Use the **present perfect** with **just**, **recently**, or **lately** to talk about events in the **very recent past**.

   #### Examples

   - We've just gotten back from Los Angeles.
   - I've recently signed a contract to write a book.
   - He hasn't had time lately.

   **Usage note:** In **spoken American English** people often use **just** and **recently** with the simple past tense to talk about indefinite time.

   #### Examples

   - We just got back from LA.
   - I just sign a contract to write a book.

   **Be careful!** Do not use **just**, **recently** or **lately** with the present perfect and a specific past time expression.

   #### Example

   - I've recently gotten back from Los Angeles.
   - **Not:** I've recently gotten back from Los Angeles last Monday.
