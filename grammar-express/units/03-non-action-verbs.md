## Grammar Explanations

1. Many verbs describe states or situations instead of actions. These are called **non-action verbs** (or stative verbs).

   - John **has** a boat. (The verb **has** describes John's situation, not something he is doing.)

   Most non-action verbs are not usually used in the present progressive even when they describe a situation that is happening right now.

   - He **wants** fish for dinner. He is wanting fish for dinner.

2. Non-Action verbs are usually verbs that:

   a. describe a **state of being**. (be, feel)

   ###### Examples

   Jane **is** tired but happy.

   She **feels** good.

   b. express **emotions** (hate, love, like)

   ###### Examples

   A: Do you **like** my new dress?
   B: I **love** it.

   c. describe **mental states** (know, remember, believe, think [=believe], suppose, understand)

   ###### Examples

   I **know** a lot of good recipes.
   Ari **remembers** your number.
   I **think** you're right.

   d. show **possession** (have, own, possess, belong)

   ###### Examples

   Cesar **has** a headache.

   Some students **own** microwaves.

   e. describe **perceptions** and **senses** (hear, see, smell, taste, feel, notice, seem, look [=seem], appear, sound)

   ###### Examples

   I **hear** the telephone.

   Dina seems tired.

   f. describe **needs** and **preferences** (need, want, prefer)

   ###### Examples

   I **need** a pen.

   g. describe **measurements** (weigh, cost, contain)

   ###### Examples

   How much **does** it **cost**?

3. **Be careful!** Some verbs can non-action and action meanings (taste, smell, feel, look, think, have, weigh).
