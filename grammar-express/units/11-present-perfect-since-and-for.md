## Grammar Explanations

1. Use the **present perfect** with **since** or **for** to talk about something that **began in the past and continues into the present** (and maybe continue into the future).

   Past----------Now----------Future

   ---[-has been------)------------

   ###### Examples

   - Martina Hingis **has been** a professional tennis player **since** 1994.

   - She **has been** a professional tennis player **for** years.

   (She began her professional career years ago, and she is still a professional player.)

2. Use the present perfect with **since** + **point in time** (since 5:00, since Monday, since 1994) **to show when something started**.

   ###### Examples

   - She **has earned** millions of dollars **since** 1994.

3. **Since** can also include a **time clause**.

   When **the action in the time clause ended in the past**, use **simple past tense**.

   ###### Examples

   - Martina **has loved** sports **since she was a child**.

   - She **has won** many tournaments **since** she **moved** from Slovakia. (She doesn't live there anymore.)

   When **the action in the clause began in the past but continues into the present**, use the **present perfect**.

   ###### Examples

   - She **has become** extremely successful **since** she **has been** in Switzerland. (She still lives in Switzerland.)

4. Use the present perfect with **for** + **length of time** (for ten minutes, for two weeks, for years, for a long time) to \*\*show how long a present condition has lasted.

   ###### Examples

   - Martina's mother **has been** her coach **for many years**.
