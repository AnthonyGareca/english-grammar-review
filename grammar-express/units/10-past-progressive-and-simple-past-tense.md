## Grammar Explanations

1. Use the **past progressive with the simple past tense** to talk about **an action that was interrupted by another action**. Use the simple past tense for the interruption action.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   ------honked--------------------

   -[-was-crossing-]---------------

   #### Examples

   - I was crossing the street when the driver honked his horn.
   - They were driving too fast when they they crashed.

   Use **when** to introduce the simple past tense action or use **while** to introduce the past progressive action.

   #### Examples

   - He was speeding when the light turned red.
   - While he was speeding, the light turned red.

2. **Be careful!** Notice the difference meaning between these two different sentences.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   ---Light changed----------------

   ------crossed street------------

   #### Examples

   - When the light changed, I crossed the street. (First the light changed. Then I crossed the street.)

   Past----------Now----------Future

   ----Light changed----------------

   ---[-was crossing-]---------------

   #### Examples

   - When the light changed, I was crossing the street. (First I was crossing the street. Then the light changed.)

3. Use the **past progressive** with **while** to talk about **two actions in process at the same time in the past**. Use the past progressive in both clauses.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   -[-was talking-]-----------------

   -[-was driving-]-----------------

   #### Examples

   - Lin was talking on the phone while he was driving.
   - They weren't paying attention while they were crossing the street.

4. The **time clause** (the part of the sentence beginning with **when** or **while**) can come at **the beginning or the end** of the sentence. The meaning is the same.

   #### Examples

   - When you called, I was leaving.
   - I was leaving when you called.

   Use a **comma** after the time clause when it comes at the **beginning** of the sentence.

   #### Examples

   - While he was driving, he was talking.
   - He was talking while he was driving.
