## Grammar Explanation

1. Use **used to** + base form of the verb to talk about **past habits** or **past situations** that no longer exist in the present.

   Past----x-----Now---------Future

   ----used to buy----------------

   #### Examples

   - Leo **used to buy** baggy jeans. (In the past, he often bought baggy jeans. He doesn't buy baggy jeans anymore.)

   **Be Careful!** **used to** always has a past meaning. There is no present tense form.

   #### Examples

   - In his youth, Leo **used to be** thin.
   - **Not:** Today Leo used to be thin.

2. We usually use **used to** in sentences that **contrast the past and the present**. We often emphasize this contrast by using time expression such as **now**, **no longer**, and **not anymore** with the present tense.

   #### Examples

   - Jeans **used to come** only in blue. **Now** you can buy them in any color.
   - They **used to live** in Genoa, but they **no longer** live there.
   - She **used to wear** a size 6, but she does**n't anymore**.

3. **Be careful!** Form **questions** with **did** + **use to**.

   #### Examples

   - **Did** you **use to** wear jeans?
   - **Not:** Did you used to wear jeans?

   Form the **negative** with **didn't** + **use to**.

   #### Examples

   - They **didn't** use to\*\* come in different colors.
   - **Not:** They didn't used to come in different colors.

   **Usage Note:** **Used to** is more common in affirmative statements than in negative statements or questions.

4. **Be careful!** Do not confuse **used to** + base form of the verb with the following expressions:

   - **be used to** (be accustomed to)
   - **get used to** (get accustomed to)

   #### Examples

   - I **used to wear** tight jeans. (It was my past habit to wear tight jeans.)
   - I'**m used to wearing** tight jeans. (It is normal for me to wear tight jeans.)
   - I **got used to wearing** tight jeans last year. (I got accustomed to wearing tight jeans.)
