## Grammar Explanation

1. We often use the **present perfect** with **already** to talk about things that **have happened before now**.

   #### Examples

   - Is your daughter going to get her flu shot?
   - She's already gotten it. (She has already gotten it.)

   **Be careful!** Do not use the present perfect with **already** when you mention a specific time in the past.

   #### Examples

   - **Don't say:** She's already gotten it last month.

   **Already** usually comes between **have** and the **past participle**.

   #### Examples

   - Researchers **have already discovered** cures of may diseases.

   **Already** can also come at the end of the clause.

   #### Examples

   - They'**ve made** a lot of progress **already**.

2. Use the **present perfect** with **not yet** to talk about things that **have not happened before now**.

   #### Examples

   - They **haven't discovered** a cure for the common cold **yet**, but they hope to discover one in the future.

   Notice that **yet** usually comes at the end of the clause.

   #### Examples

   - The flu season **hasn't arrived yet**.

   **Yet** can also come between **have not** and the **past participle**.

   #### Examples

   - They **haven't yet discovered** a cure for the common cold.

3. We usually use **yet** in **questions** to **find out if something has happened before now**.

   #### Examples

   - Has your son gotten his flu shot yet?

   **Usage notes:** Sometimes we **use already in a question** to express **surprise** that **something happened sooner than expected**.

   #### Examples

   - Has he already gotten his flu shot? The flu season hasn't begun yet.
