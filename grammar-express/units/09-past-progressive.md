## Grammar Explanations

1. Use the **past progressive** to **describe an action that was in progress at a specific time in the past**. The action began before the specific time and may or may not continue after the specific time.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   -----Skiing----------------------

   --[---3:00---]-------------------

   #### Examples

   - What were you doing at 3:00?
   - We were skiing.
   - I was eating lunch at 3:00.

   **Be careful!** Non-action verbs are not usually used in the progressive.

   #### Examples

   - I had a headache last night.
   - **Not:** I was having a headache last night.

2. Use the **past progressive** with **_while_** to talk about **two actions in progress at the same time in the past**. Use the past progressive in both clauses.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   ----was skiing-------------------

   ----was reading------------------

   ####

   - While he was skiing, I was reading.
   - I was reading while he was skiing.

   **Usage Note:** In informal conversation, some people use **when** with the past progressive.

   #### Examples

   - Sorry, I wasn't listening when you were talking.

3. Use the **past progressive** to **focus on the duration of an action**, **not is completion**.

   #### Examples

   - Sheila was reading a book last night. ( We don't know if she finished the book.)

   Use the **simple past tense** to focus on the **completion** of an action.

   #### Examples

   - Sheila read a book last night. (She probably finished the book.)
