## Grammar Explanations

1. Use the **present perfect progressive** to talk about thing that **started in the past and continue up to the present**. The situation is usually not finished, and it will probably continue into the future.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   -[have been collecting)----------

   #### Examples

   - I'**ve been collecting** Beanie Babies for four years. (I started collecting them four years ago, and I'm still collecting them.)
   - I'**ve been playing** volleyball for ten years. (I started playing volleyball ten year ago, and I'm still playing it.)
   - She'**s been writing** her book for fifteen months. (She started to write her book fifteen months ago, and she is still writing it.)
   - They'**ve have working** here for one year. (They started to work here for one year ago, and They are still working here.)

   **Remember**: Non-action verbs are usually not used in the progressive.

   #### Example

   - I'**ve owned** this doll for years. **NOT:** I've been owning this doll for year.

2. Use the **present perfect progressive** to describe things that **have stopped very recently**. The actions is not happening right now, but **you can still see the results** of the action.

   ### Examples

   - The kids **have been playing** here. Their toys are all over the room.
   - It'**s been raining**. The streets are still wet.
   - The radio **has been playing** music. It's still hot.
   - We **have been running** to here. We're still sweaty.
