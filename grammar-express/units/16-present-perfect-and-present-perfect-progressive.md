## Grammar Explanation

1. The **present perfect** often shows that something is **finished**. It focuses on the **result** of the action.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   --[have read]----------------------

   #### Examples

   - We've studied three months for the test
   - She's written an article. (She finished writing it.)
   - They've aten five chicken for lunch.

   The **present perfect progressive** often shows that an activity is ** unfinished**. It focuses on the **continuation** of an action.

   Past----------Now----------Future

   -[have been reading)-------------

   #### Examples

2. We often use the **present perfect** to talk about:

   - **How much** someone has done.
   - **How many time** someone has done something.
   - **How many things** someone has done.

   #### Examples

   - You've written thousands of articles.
   - She's coded dozens of systems.
   - He's bought tons of smart bands.
   - We've searched the response once.

   - She's written the best algorithm once.
   - I've read five books.
   - She's watched ten series on the weekend.
   - We've written sixteen entries in English.

   We often use the **present perfect progressive** to talk about **how long** something has been happening.

   #### Examples

   - I've been reading books on elephants for two months.
   - You've been training volley for seven years.
   - He's been playing tournaments for five months.
   - We've been locked down for two years.
   - They've been sung all the night.
   - She's been slept since yesterday.

   **Be careful!** We usually do not use the present perfect progressive when we mention a **number** of completed events.

   #### Examples

   - I've read that book twice. (NOT: I've been reading that book twice.)
   - You've played two finals. (NOT: You've been playing two finals.)
   - He's ridden the road once. (NOT: He's been riding the road once.)
   - We've gone to the church three times. (NOT: We've been going to the church three times.)

3. Sometime you can use either the **present perfect** or the **present perfect progressive**. The meaning is basically the same. This is especially true when you use verbs such as **live**, **work**, **study**, and **teach** with **for** or **since**.
