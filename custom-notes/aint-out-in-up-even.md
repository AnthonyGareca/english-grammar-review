# Notes

## Ain't

**Ain't** can mean many things. It can mean "is not", "are not", am not", have not", or "has not".

**Ain't** is considered a casual, kind of rough word. It is also part of the style of speech used in a region or community.

In many cases, we follow **ain't** with a negative.

* **Ain't** nobody = There isn't anybody.
* **Ain't** nothing = There isn't anything.
* **Ain't** never = I've never./[subject] has never.
* I **ain't** got no [noun] = I don't have any [noun].

## Wide awake

To be **wide awake** means to be awake, but usually we typically use it to describe being awake at a time whe we are usually asleep.

We use it to express times when we cannot close out eyes and go to sleep.

* I woke up at 2 AM! I was **wide awake** for hours!
* When I got up to use the bathroom, I saw my dog was **wide awake**.

## Scrape/Scratch

In many cases, they communicate the same idea.

**Scrape** is usually used for non-living things. We often use it to talk about moving a very heavy or sharp object.

(sharp: adjective, [of an object] having an edge or point that is able to cut or pierce something) (pierce: verb, make a hole with a sharp instrument)

**Scrape** is often used when we talk about trying to remove something that is difficult to remove.

* Oh no! I **scraped** my car on the gate.
* I **scraped** the paint off the wall with a knife.

**Scratch** is used more commonly with living things.

**Scratch** is used when talking about dragging a sharp part of the body (like nails, claws, or even teeth) across a surface.

* Ouch! I **scratched** my arm!
* Be careful! My cat might **scratch** you!

## Out/in/up

We often use **up** with (bodily) motion verbs to mean "do that action until [X] point." It's like we moved to that thing and stopped.

Common examples:

Walk **up**

Run **up**

Open **up**

Close **up**

Go **up**

Open/Close **up** emphasize completing the action: they are common as commands.

* I walked **up** to the door and opened it.
* I went **up** to the door and opened it.
* I walked **up** to my boos and asked if she had a moment.

we can use "**over**" similarly:
* My coworker ran **over** my desk to help me.

**Down** is not used in this way. We may use **down** after a verb like "go" or "run" or "walk" (or other travel-related verb) to express moving down (or south).

* I'm going **down** to city.
* I'm going **down** to the post office.

Generally, **in** and **out** in phrasal verbs follow the same rules as the preposition follow.

We use phrasal verbs with **in** and **out** when talking about entering or exiting something, or when talking about inserting or removing something.

* He walked **in** to the bank.
* They ran **out** of the police station.

## Even

surprising against expectation. (When you think something will happen because else happen)

* **Even though** I was late, my boss wasn't angry.
* **Even if** I win the lottery, I won't have enough money to buy a country.
* **Even when/after** he presented the evidence, no one believe him.

Sometimes the word *even* gives you extra information

* No one thought Tom's joke was funny, not **even** Kathy.
* **Even** Superman wouldn't be able to defeat him.
* I really want to eat a burger I could **even** go right now.
* Sure the Rockies are huge, but the Himalayas are **even** bigger.
