# Have to/Got to/Need to

Use to express responsibilities; things that are very important to do.

What's the difference?

**Have to** and **Need to** can be used interchangeably. However, there are tiny differences in feeling.

- **Have to**: outside responsibility.
- **Need to**: basic life requirement.

Note: Use the negative form for something we can reasonably imagine you have a responsibility to do.

## How to make questions

[Wh-q] + do + I/you/we/they + have to/need to + [infinitive verb]

[Wh-q] + does + he/she/it + have to/need to + [infinitive verb]

- Who do I have to speak about it?
- Where does she have to go?
- Why does he have to get a pencil?
- When do you need to visit the restroom?
- Where does she have to send the letter?

To affirmative/negative questions the most of cases only remove the [wh-q] part.

- Do we have to submit our reports?
- Do I have to speak about it with someone? (the questions change a bit to get more sense)
- Does she have to go?
- Does he have to get a pen?
- Do you have to visit the restroom?
- Does she have to send the email?

## Have got to? Got to? Gotta?

Have got to more common in British English.

Note: I have got to => I've got to => I've gotta => I gotta

**I gotta** is used in American English (casual).

Don't write "gotta" in formal or professional emails.

For he/she/it the form is: She's gotta. (She has got to)

**ought to** is like **should**

- I gotta eat a couple of bananas to launch.
- He's gotta write an email to the clients.
- We gotta have an amazing party this year.
- She's gotta travel to Europa for business.
